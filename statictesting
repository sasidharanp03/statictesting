                          Equivalence Paritioning:

Identify the different sets of inputs based on the software's requirements. These sets are divided into partitions of equivalent data, which are often categorized as either valid or invalid.

Create test cases:
Choose one representative value from each of these partitions to create a single test case. For example, if a system accepts numbers between 1 and 200, the partitions might be:

Valid: 1-200

Invalid: 0 or less

Invalid: Greater than 200

Test Case:
        -> Example: Age validation

A common example is testing a form that requires a user's age to be between 10 and 60.

Valid partition: Ages 10-60. A test case could be a user aged 45.

Invalid partition: Ages 0-9. A test case could be a user aged 7.

Invalid partition: Ages 61 and above. A test case could be a user aged 70.



                    Boundary Value Analysis:

Boundary value analysis is a software testing technique that focuses on testing the limits of input ranges, such as the minimum and maximum values, because errors are often found at these boundaries.

Working:
Identify boundaries: For a given input range (e.g., age from 20 to 80), the minimum is 22 and the maximum is 80.
Test values: Create test cases using values around the boundaries:
* Minimum boundary: Test the minimum value itself, one value below it, and one value above it (e.g., 19, 20, 21).
* Maximum boundary: Test the maximum value itself, one value below it, and one value above it (e.g., 79, 80, 81).
* Test valid and invalid inputs: Ensure the software handles both valid boundary conditions (like 20 and 80) and invalid boundary conditions (like 19 and 81) correctly.
* Focus on edge cases: By testing these extreme values, you can uncover errors that result from off-by-one mistakes, such as using ">" instead of "≥" in a conditional statement.

Example:
For an application that requires a password between 30 and 65 characters:
-> Valid values: Test with 30, 31, 64, and 65 characters.
-> Invalid values: Test with 29 characters and 66 characters to ensure the system rejects them

Points to consider in BVA:
-> A boundary value for a valid partition is a valid boundary value.
-> A boundary value for an invalid partition is an invalid boundary value.

BVA scenario:
-> Minimum value.
-> Just above the minimum.
-> Nominal Value.
-> Just below Max value.
-> Max value.
